## Tutorial

[http://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction/]

A bit outdated, so adapt to the recent version by yourself.

## Setup and Running

gem5 is not friendly with virtual environments, such as conda. Disable them before proceeding.

```bash
$ conda deactivate
$ git clone https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5
$ cd gem5
$ python3 `which scons` build/X86/gem5.opt -j65
$ # running
$ build/X86/gem5.opt configs/some_python_script.py
$ # with debug flag
$ build/X86/gem5.opt --debug-flags=Hello configs/learning_gem5/part2/run_hello.py
```
