## Introduction

### Terminology

* Core
A component is termed a core if it contains an independent instruction fetch unit.
A core might support multiple hardware threads(harts) through multithreading

### Execution Environment Interface(EEI)

Initial state of the program
Number and type of harts
Accessibility and attributes of memory and I/O regions
Behavior of all legal instructions executed on each hart (ISA)
Handling of any interrupts or exceptions raised during execution

EEI is reponsible for ensuring the eventual forward progress of each of its harts. The following events constitute forward progress:
* The retirement of an instruction
* A trap
* Any other event defined by an extension

Distinction between a hard and a software thread context:
The software running inside an execution environment is not responsible for causing progress of each of its harts; that is the responsibility of the outer execution environment.

### ISA Overview

RISC-V ISA = a base integer ISA + optional extensions
A base is carfully restricted to a minimal set of instructions

XLEN = the width of an integer register in bits

Actually, there are currently four base ISAs.
* RV32I and RV64I
* RV32E, which has half the number of integer registers
* RV128I for future

RISC-V instruction-set encoding space
* Standard: defined by the Foundation
* Reserved: currently not defined but are saved for future standard
* Custom: never be used for standard and are made available for vendor-specific extensions

The term *non-conforming* describes a non-standard extension that uses either a standard or a reserved encoding (i.e., conflict with standard)

* I : the base interger ISA
* M : integer multiplication and division extension
* A : atomics for inter-processor synchronization
* F : single-precision floating-point extension
* D : double-precision floating-point extension
* C : compressed instruction (16-bit forms)

### Memory

A RISC-V hart has a single byte-addressable address space of `2^XLEN` bytes for all memory accesses.
word = 32 bits = 4 bytes
halfword = 16 bits = 2 bytes
doubleword = 64 bits = 8 bytes
quadword  = 128 bits
Memory address space is circular, so that the byte at address `2^XLEN-1` is adjacent to the byte at address zero.

EE determines the mapping of hardware resources into a hart's address space. Each range may (1) be vacant, (2) contain main memory, or (3) contain one or more I/O devices. Reads and writes of I/O devices may have side effects, but accesses to main memory cannot. Although it is possible for EE to call every range an I/O device, it is usually expected that some portion will be specified as main memory.

When RISC-V platform has multiple harts, the address space of any two harts may be entirely the same, or entirely different, or may be partly different but sharing some subset of resources, mapped into the same or different address ranges.

Executing each RISC-V machine instruction entails one or more memory accesses, subdivided into implicit and explicti accesses. For each instruction executed, an implicit memory read (instruction fetch) is done. EE may dictate other implicit memory accesses (such as to implement address translation). Specific load and store instructions perform an explicit read or write.

EE determines what portions of the non-vacant address space are accessible for each kind of memory access(implicit or explicit, read or write). Vacant locations are never accessible.

Except when specified otherwise, implicit reads that do not raise an exception and that have no side effects may occur arbitrarily early and speculatively, even before the machine could possibly prove that the read will be needed. To ensure that certain implicit reads are ordered only after write to the same memory locations, software must execute specific fence or cache-control instruction defined for this purpose(such as FENCE.I).
(의문: 왜 implicit reads에만 예외를 뒀을까???)

The memory accesses (implicit or explicit) made by a hart may appear to occur in a different order as perceived by another hart or by any other agent that can access the same memory. This perceived reordering of memory accesses is always constrained, however, by the applicable memory consistency model. The default memory consistency model for RISC-V is the RISC-V Weak Memory Ordering (RVWMO), defined in Chapter 14 and in appendices. Optionally, an implementation may adopt the stronger model of Total Store Ordering, as defined in Chapter 23. The execution environment may also add constraints that further limit the perceived reordering of memory accesses. Since the RVWMO model is the weakest model allowed for any RISC-V implementation, software written for this model is compatible with the actual memory consistency rules of all RISC-V implementations. As with implicit reads, software must execute fence or cache-control instructions to ensure specific ordering of memory accesses beyond the requirements of the assumed memory consistency model and execution environment.

### Instruction Encoding

IALIGN = instruction-address alignment constraint the implementation enfores. measure in bits. 16 or 32. 32 in the base ISA, but relaxed to 16 in some ISA extensions(such as C).
ILEN = maximum instruction length supported by an implementation. multiple of IALIGN. For implementations supporting only a base instruction set, ILEN is 32 bits.

Rationale:
압축 포맷을 지원하되, 압축 포맷이 필수는 아닌 방향으로 설계함. 표준 IMAFD ISA 구현시 32-bit 명령이므로 I-cache에 30-bit만 집어넣으면 됨(6.25% 절약). RV32I 기준 encoding space를 1/8도 사용하지 않으므로 커스텀 확장을 많이 집어 넣을수 있음. 상위 2비트가 11이 아니게 하여 사용할수도 있음(non-conforming이지만). All-zero-bits 명령은 illegal instruction이 되도록 설계되어 있음.

Instructions are stored in memory as a sequence of 16-bit little-endian parcels, regardless of memory system endianness. (i.e., least-significant 16-bit goes to the lowest address. Byte order inside 16-bit depends on memory system endianness.)
Rationale:
Length-encoding bits always appear first in halfword address order.
Big-endian JIT compilers, for example, must swap the byte order when storing to instruction memory.

### Exceptions, Traps, and Interrupts

* Exception: an unusual condition occurring at runtime associated with an instruction in the current RISC-V hart
* Interrupt: an external asynchronous event that may cause a RISC-V hart to experience an unexpected transfer of control
* Trap: the transfer of control to a trap handler caused by either an exception or an interrupt

The general behavior of most RISC-V EEIs is that a trap to some handler occurs when an exception is signaled on an instruction. The manner in which interrupts are generated, routed to, and enable by a hart depends on the EEI. How traps are handled and made visible to software running on the hart depends on the enclosing EE.

RISC-V's exception and trap is compatible with that in the IEEE-754 floating-point standard.
(의문: IEEE-754에 exception과 trap 정의가 있나?)

Four effects from traps:
* Contained trap: The trap is visible to, and handled by, software running inside the EE. For example, when a hart is interrupted, an interrupt handler will be run.
* Requested trap: The trap is a synchronous exception that is an explicit call to the EE. An example is a system call. Execution may or may not resume on the hart.
* Invisible trap: The trap is handled transparently by the EE and EE resumes normally after the trap is handled. Examples include emulating missing instructions, or handling non-resident page faults.
* Fatal trap: The trap represents a fatal failure and causes the EE to terminate execution. Examples include failing a virtual-memory page-protection check.

## RV32I

40개 명령으로 구성. 교육목적 이외에는 부분집합만 사용했을때 이득이 없도록 설계, i.e., 진짜 필요한 것만 넣었으니 다 구현하세요.

### Registers

XLEN = 32
x0-x31, PC
x0는 0으로 고정

No dedicated stack pointer or link register. However, the standard software calling convention is:
x1 = return address
x5 = link register
x2 = stack pointer
Hardware might choose to accelerate function calls and returns that use x1 or x5. See JAL and JALR.
Compressed format is designed around the assumption that x1 is the return address and x2 is stack pointer.

### Instructions

There are 4 formats, R/I/S/U, and 2 variants, B/J.
R = register
I = immediate
S = store
U = upper?
B = branch
J = jump

IALIGN=32

An instruction-address-misaligned exception is generated on a taken branch or unconditional jump if the target address is not four-byte aligned. This exception is reported on the branch or jump instruction, not on the target instruction. No instruction-address-misaligned exception is generated for a conditional branch that is not taken.

레지스터 디코딩이 보통 크리티컬 패스에 있어서 rs1, rs2, rd는 항상 같은 위치에 있도록 디자인. 대신 imm 위치는 포맷마다 다름. S-type에서는 imm이 심지어 둘로 쪼개진다.

imm의 최상위 비트는 항상 bit 31에 있게 하여 sign-extension이 instruction decoding과 병렬로 일어날 수 있도록 설계. Zero-extension은 쓸모 있는 경우가 안보여서 아예 안넣었다고 함.

S-type의 변형으로 B-type이 있음. imm이 2의 배수라고 가정하고 imm[0] 자리에 imm[11]을 넣음. 최상위 비트 위치는 그대로.(imm[11] -> imm[12]) 마찬가지로 U-type의 변형인 J-type이 있음.

### Integer Computational Instructions

Integer Register-Immediate Insts. (mostly I-type format)
ADDI: rd = rs1 + imm
SLTI: rd = rs1 < imm (signed)
SLTIU: rd = rs1 < imm (unsigned)
ANDI: rd = rs1 & imm
ORI: rd = rs1 | imm
XORI: rd = rs1 ^ imm
SLLI: rd = rs1 << imm
SRLI: rd = rs1 >> imm (logical)
SRAI: rd = rs1 >> imm (arithmetic)
LUI: rd = {imm[31:12], 12'b0}
AUIPC: rd = {imm[31:12], 12'b0} + PC

Integer Register-Register Ops. (mostly R-type format)
ADD: rd = rs1 + rs2
SLT: rd = rs1 < rs2 (signed)
SLTU: rd = rs1 < rs2 (unsigned)
AND: rd = rs1 & rs2
OR: rd = rs1 | rs2
XOR: rd = rs1 ^ rs2
SLL: rd = rs1 << rs2
SRL: rd = rs1 >> rs2 (logical)
SUB: rd = rs1 - rs2
SRA: rd = rs1 >> rs2 (arithmetic)

MV rd, rs1 = ADDI rd, rs1, 0
SEQZ rd, rs = SLTIU rd, rs1, 1
NOT rd, rs = XORI rd, rs1, -1
SNEZ rd, rs = SLTU rd, x0, rs2
NOP = ADDI x0, x0, 0

의문:
* imm가 32-bit가 안되는데 큰수는 어떻게 더하지? -> There are 20-bit imm instruction(LUI, AUIPC) and 12-bit imm instructions(JALR, load/store). A combination of two can acheive arbitrary 32-bit calculation.
* SRAI는 왜 imm[11:5]를 0100000으로 주지? 나머지는 all-zero인데? -> OP-IMM에서 funct3가 3비트라 8개 가능한데, OP가 9개라서 SRAI is distinguished by imm bit
* Why no SUBI?

### Control Transfer Instructions

Control transfer instructions in RV32I do not have architecturally visible delay slots.

#### Unconditional Jumps

JAL: jumps to (address of jump + imm), 1MiB range, rd=pc+4
JAL = jump and link
J = JAL with x0 (pseudo)
JALR: jumps to (rs1 + imm), rd=pc+4

#### Return-address prediction

Return-address prediction stacks are a common feature of high-performance instruction-fetch units, but require accurate detection of instructions used for procedure calls and returns to be effective. For RISC-V, hints as to the instructions' usage are encoded implicitly via the register numbers used.

Rule
```
+-------+-------+--------+----------------+-----------+
|  rd   |  rs1  | rs1=rd |   RAS action   |  Comment  |
+-------+-------+--------+----------------+-----------+
| !link | !link |      - | none           |           |
| !link | link  |      - | pop            | Return    |
| link  | !link |      - | push           | Call      |
| link  | link  |      0 | pop, then push | Coroutine |
| link  | link  |      1 | push           | Call      |
+-------+-------+--------+----------------+-----------+
* link is true when the register is either x1 or x5
```

The fourth case supports ping-pong between two routines(i.e., coroutine).
The fifth case is considered as call(not return) to support LUI-JALR and AUIPC-JALR patterns such as `lui ra, imm20; jalr ra, imm12(ra)`.

#### Conditional Branches

4KiB range
BEQ: jumps to (pc + imm) if rs1==rs2
BNE: jumps to (pc + imm) if rs1!=rs2
BLT: jumps to (pc + imm) if rs1<rs2 (signed)
BLTU: jumps to (pc + imm) if rs1<rs2 (unsigned)
BGE: jumps to (pc + imm) if rs1>=rs2 (signed)
BGEU: jumps to (pc + imm) if rs1>=rs2 (unsigned)

Signed array bounds may be checked with a single BLTU instruction, since any negative index will compare greater than any nonnegative bound.
Software should be optimized such that the sequential code path is the most common path.
Software should also assume that backward branches will be predicted taken and forward branches as not taken.
Unlike some other architectures, the RISC-V jump(JAL with rd=x0) instruction should always be used for unconditional branches instead of a conditional branch instrtuction with always-true condition.

The conditional branches were designed to include arithmetic comparison operations between two registers, rather than:
* using condition codes (x86, ARM, SPARC, PowerPC)
* comparing one register against zero (Alpha, MIPS) and allowing two registers only for equality (MIPS)
because:
* combined compare-and-branch instruction fits into a regular pipeline, and reduces static code size and dynamic instruction fetch traffic
* comparisons agains zero requires a circuit almost as expensive as arithmetic comparison anyway
* branches are observed earlier, and so can be predicted earlier
* in the case where multiple branches can be taken based on the same condition codes, a design with condition codes has an advantage, but this case seems to be rare

Static branch hints are not included because:
* can reduce the pressure on dynamic predictors but,
* require more instruction encoding space
* require profiling, and can result in poor performance if production runs do not match profiling runs

Conditional moves and predicated instructions are not included because:
* cmov is difficult to use with code that might cause exceptions
* predication adds additional state to a system, addition instructions to set and clear flags, and additional encoding overhead
* add complexity to OoO microarchitecture
* both are designed to replace unpredictable short forward branches, but various microarchitectural techniques exist to dynamically convert unpredictable short forward branches into internally predicated code to avoid the cost of flushing pipelines on a branch mispredict and have been implemented in commercial processors. (IBM POWER7?)

### Load and Store Instructions

RV32I is a load-store architecture, where only load and store instruction access memory.

In RISC-V, endianness is byte-address invariant. (i.e., if a byte is stored to memory at some address in some endianness, then a byte-sized load from that address in any endianness returns the stored value.)

In a little-endian configuration, multi-byte stores write the least-significnat register byte at the lowest memory byte address.
In a big-endian configuraiton, multi-byte stores write the most-significant register byte at the lowest memory byte address.

LW: rd = mem[rs1+imm] (32-bit)
LH: rd = mem[rs1+imm] (16-bit, sign-extend)
LHU: rd = mem[rs1+imm] (16-bit, zero-extend)
LB: rd = mem[rs1+imm] (8-bit, sign-extend)
LBU: rd = mem[rs1+imm] (8-bit, zero-extend)
SW: mem[rs1+imm] = rs2 (32-bit)
SH: mem[rs1+imm] = rs2 (low 16-bit)
SB: mem[rs1+imm] = rs2 (low 8-bit)

### Memory Ordering Instructions

FENCE instruction

Any combination of device input(I), device output(O), memory reads(R), and memory write(W) may be ordered w.r.t. any combination of the same.
Informally, no other RISC-V hart or external device can observe any operation in the successor set following a FENCE before any operation in the predecessor set preceding the FENCE.

FENCE.TSO = fm=1000, pred=RW, succ=RW (backward-compatible since old RISC-V core see this as FENCE RW, RW)
FENCE.TSO orders all load operations in its predecessor set before all memory ops in its successor set, and all store operations in its predecessor set before all store operations in its successor set. (i.e., only relax write-to-read)
(TSO = total store order)

### Environment Call and Breakpoints

ECALL: make a service request to EE
EBREAK: return control to a debugging environment

Similar to SVC and BKPT in ARM.

### HINT instructions

HINTs are usually used to communicate performance hints to the microarchitecture.
HINTs are encoded as integer computational instructions with rd=x0.
Like NOP, HINTs do not change any architecturally visible state, except for advancing the pc and any applicable performance counters.

이렇게 정의된 이유는, HINT를 skip하는 기능조차 구현되지 않은 간단한 코어에서는 그냥 HINT 명령을 실제로 실행해도 상관없도록 하기 위해서임.
